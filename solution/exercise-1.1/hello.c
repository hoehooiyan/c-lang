// Exercise 1.1
// Run "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get

// #include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, Hooi Yan!\n");
  return 0;
}

// I leave out the statement to include the library needed for the program to run
// It crashes and shows a bunch of errors telling me what is wrong
// I need to include it as the printf function is provided by the library
